Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that uses quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to quantum superposition. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, with potential applications in cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, AI, and more.
==================================================
Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics principles like superposition and entanglement to process information. It has the potential to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, such as breaking cryptographic codes and simulating physical systems. However, current quantum computers are experimental and face challenges like quantum decoherence and error rates.
